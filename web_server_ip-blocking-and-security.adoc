= IP Blocking & Security a Web Server



== Lightspeed Server with WHM / CPanel

WHM provides a way to allow/block IPs using the Firewall . Otherwise, you can use .htaccess rules to block by IP.

If the server is behind a Proxy, some LightSpeed config changes might be needed. One key option to check is "Use Client IP from Header", if it's set to YES, then the REMOTE_ADDR will be changes to match X-FORWARDED-FOR header .
PHP will also create the ENV Variable PROXY_REMOTE_ADDR when it detects an X-FORWARDED-FOR header .
