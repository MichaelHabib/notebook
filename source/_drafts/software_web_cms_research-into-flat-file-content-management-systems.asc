= Research into free web flat-file CMS
:toc:

== Purpose: I'm looking for a flat file cms to avoid dealing with databases & possible data loss. With flat-file CMs, data will be store in single text files allowing easy editing, backup, search and sharing.
_CMS is ANY system used to manage content & not just software used to create business websites._

== Selection Criteria: 

* Must be free to download & use software (Open source).
* Web based: installable  on a web server for anywhere access.
* Support for at least 1 Markup language as the input markup (Not including HTML or XML )
** Markup languages to consider are : Markdown, Asciidoc, and wiki syntax.
* Flat-file data (but allow database for software operations). so all content must be stored in files BUT software config & other data might use a database.
