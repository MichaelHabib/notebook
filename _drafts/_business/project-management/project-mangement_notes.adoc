== Notes

- Treat everything as project. Every task is part of project ?
** In this case, is there a difference between a project and a process ?



- Create an index of all projects . Currently using AirTable to create a PM system that contains this list.
- Projects should contains information about every project stage .
- Project should list all dependencies if applicable .
- Project type & objectives change based on perspective !

== Vocabulary 

- Project Phase : One of the key 5 project phases such as initiation, planning , excution, control and closure. 
- Project Stage : A collection of milestones, when completed, the project warents a re-assessment of next steps & deliverables .
- Project Milestone : is a deliverable in the excution phase of a project.  

== Project Cycles (Option A )

- Initiation
- Planning
- Execution
- Monitoring & Control
- Closure


=== What's Included in each Project Cycle ?


==== Initiation: Set goal, resources & contract .

==== Planning: Gather requirements, create all plans, list & allocate resources, draw diagrams, set purpose, vision, etc .

==== Execution: Implement the plans !

==== Monitoring: Track project progress & ensure deliverables are being worked on.
- Could this include accounting, billing, as described in service project -> Account & Bill ?

==== Closure: This can include initiating a spinoff project, analysing the work & extracting artifacts; delivering the project; project handover .
- Could this include calculating margins/profits as described in professional service project -> Analyse

-  Planning Phase: Determine resource availability, create a budget and begin allowcating tasks & resources .
- Execution Phase : This is when the work is done; resources, budgets and time are tracked; resources planning can be optimized and major roadblocks are identified and dealt with .
- Termination / Closure Phase : Confirm project completion criteria are met, generate closure report; collect project artifacts; and plan any spinogg / post-mortem projects .
